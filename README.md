## Copying functionality to an existing firmware

In order to move this functionality to some existing firmware code, perform
the following steps:
1. Copy the `mongoose/` folder to your project
2. Edit the `mongoose/mongoose_config.h` file to adopt for your environment.
   See [Build Options](https://mongoose.ws/documentation/#build-options)
   for details
3. Add `mongoose/` to your include paths, and `mongoose/*.c` to source files.
   This depends on your IDE
4. Add the following to your code (e.g. to the `main()` function):

```c
#include "mongoose_glue.h"

...
mongoose_init();

// This blocks forever. Put this at the end of main(),
// or in a separate RTOS task. Give that task 8k stack space.
for (;;) {
  mongoose_poll();
}
```
